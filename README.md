# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning on anonymized credit card data.

## 🔍 Overview
This project involves building a binary classification model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using highly imbalanced data.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Features are anonymized due to confidentiality (PCA applied).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SMOTE

## 🚀 Project Steps
1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Handling class imbalance (SMOTE)
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC
